# **License Change Notice**
The original intention of this project was not for it to be used for paid services even those disguised as 'donations.'

In this release, we have updated the project's license. The previous GPL license has been replaced with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0).

What this means:

The project is now licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, which allows you to use, modify, and share the software only for **non-commercial** purposes.
**Commercial use, including using the software to provide paid services or selling it (even if donations are involved), is not allowed under this license.**
The new license applies to this and all future releases; unfortunately, previous versions remain under the GPL.

*Hi, I'm kevinnnn, the sole developer of PTCGP Bot since June 2025. Many community members have put countless hours into this bot. I now maintain it by myself since June 2025 and have put hundreds of hours into it myself. The bot will always be free, but you can "buy me a coffee" at:*

# **__Arturo's Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot__**
*Special thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB/graphs/contributors)! Thanks to everyone else who has helped test or has contributed their suggestions to make the bot better!*

**__What does this do?__**
Creates bots and looks for desireable cards to save and trade to your main account, or to wonderpick from your main account. Getting setup for wonderpick takes weeks of daily pulls to reach 96 packs opened before being elibile to be visible within Wonder Pick, but if you wish to simply find cards to trade to your main, you can get setup quickly!
